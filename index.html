						<h3>What is a Hackathon?</h3>
					</div>
					<div class='content'>
						<p>Hackathons originated in Silicon Valley and are now regularly staged all over the world as a way of rapidly producing ideas and building prototypes. They follow a basic structure - developers, designers and business people form small teams with the goal of designing and implementing a digital product or service prototype to be demonstrated at the end of the event. The lack of time participants have means methods of working can often be chaotic and require "hacking" solutions together, hence the term Hackathon.</p>

				<div class='expand-container item non-selectable'>
					<div class='faq-heading heading'>
						<h3>Are you going to be hacking into computers?</h3>
					</div>
					<div class='content'>
						<p>No, there will not be any computer hacking going on. The point of the event is to make things, not break into things.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				
				<div class='expand-container item non-selectable'>
					<div class='faq-heading heading'>
						<h3>So this has nothing to do with Hacky Sack?</h3>
					</div>
					<div class='content'>
						<p>No, although people are welcome to bring them and play if it helps with brainstorming or relaxing for a bit.</p>

					<div class='faq-heading heading'>
						<h3>It sounds fun but I don't know anything about programming, so I suppose I'm out...</h3>
					</div>
					<div class='content'>
						<p>Wait! Programming is part of the event, but is really just a technical means to an end. Before the programming happens there needs to be problems identified to be solved and creative ideas generated to tackle them. We need people with ideas and knowledge of other industries to get involved so that together we can figure out how to use technology to solve problems and make awesome things.</p>

						<h3>What should I build at Hackagong?</h3>
					</div>
					<div class='content'>
						<p>Since you've only got a maximum of 30 hours, we're not expecting fully developed and polished products. Most teams will build a small prototype that solves a particular problem or is just really cool. So things like small web and mobile apps, for example this one from last year: <a href="http://www.infinitesmall.com/">Infinite Small</a>. There are various <a href="/prizes">prize categories</a> to work towards, so be sure to checkout the details. Last year's overall winner displayed business viability and are now continuing to operate as a local startup called <a href="http://giftling.com/">Giftling</a>.</p>

						<h3>How do we make sure people don't bring in 90% finished projects and pretend they did it all on the weekend?</h3>
					</div>
					<div class='content'>
						<p>Teams should do all the development on the weekend. You're allowed to research the tools/concepts/ideas beforehand. That said, we know a few teams often have some code written prior to the weekend. It's too difficult to police and we don't want to be doing code reviews. If your product is obviously too polished and full featured to have been done in the weekend, the judges will be able to tell and will judge accordingly. Hackagong (and any hackathon) isn't about producing a full featured product, it's about identifying a particular problem and hacking together a prototype of a solution.</p>
