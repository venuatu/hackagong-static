				    <h4 class="faq-heading accordion-title">What is a Hackathon?</h4>
					<div class="faq-content accordion-content">
						<p>Hackathons originated in Silicon Valley and are now regularly staged all over the world as a way of rapidly producing ideas and building prototypes. They follow a basic structure - developers, designers and business people form small teams with the goal of designing and implementing a digital product or service prototype to be demonstrated at the end of the event. The lack of time participants have means methods of working can often be chaotic and require "hacking" solutions together, hence the term Hackathon.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="faq-wrap accordion-item">
				    <h4 class="faq-heading accordion-title">Who created and organises Hackagong?</h4>
					<div class="faq-content accordion-content">
						<p>Hackagong was started in 2012 by Nathan Waters along with other volunteers (primarily UOW students). Hackagong is run and organised entirely by unpaid volunteers, and the event is funded completely by corporate sponsorship, with some assistance from UOW faculties. UOW/iAccelerate have no ownership in, did not create, and do not run Hackagong in any way. Hackagong is a grassroots, non-profit organisation setup with the mission of igniting startup and maker communities in the Illawarra and surrounding regions.</p>

				<div class="faq-wrap accordion-item">
				    <h4 class="faq-heading accordion-title">Are you going to be hacking into computers?</h4>
					<div class="faq-content accordion-content">
						<p>No, there will not be any computer hacking going on. The point of the event is to make things, not break into things.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="faq-wrap accordion-item">
				    <h4 class="faq-heading accordion-title">So this has nothing to do with Hacky Sack?</h4>
					<div class="faq-content accordion-content">
						<p>No, although people are welcome to bring them and play if it helps with brainstorming or relaxing for a bit.</p>

				    <h4 class="faq-heading accordion-title">It sounds fun but I don't know anything about programming, so I suppose I'm out...</h4>
					<div class="faq-content accordion-content">
						<p>Wait! Programming is part of the event, but is really just a technical means to an end. Before the programming happens there needs to be problems identified to be solved and creative ideas generated to tackle them. We need people with ideas and knowledge of other industries to get involved so that together we can figure out how to use technology to solve problems and make awesome things. Hackagong also includes many 3D printing, design, hardware hacking and indie game development competitions.</p>

				<div class="faq-wrap accordion-item">
				    <h4 class="faq-heading accordion-title">Do I need a team and how can I find one?</h4>
					<div class="faq-content accordion-content">
						<p>You're welcome to compete solo, but it's much more fun in a team. If you're looking for team members, post in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/hackagongers/" target="_blank">Hackagongers Facebook group</a> and attend our <a href="http://hackagong.eventbrite.com.au" target="_blank">pre-event meetups and workshops</a>.</p>
					</div>
				</div>	
				<div class="faq-wrap accordion-item">
				    <h4 class="faq-heading accordion-title">Is there a team size limit?</h4>
					<div class="faq-content accordion-content">
						<p>Nope. However we'd recommend no more than 5, and ideally 3: coder, designer, business/marketer. The more people you have in your team, the harder it becomes to manage and effectively split tasks (too many cooks). Also the more people in your team, the more people you need to split prizes with.</p>
					</div>

				<div class="faq-wrap accordion-item">
				    <h4 class="faq-heading accordion-title">I don't have a project idea. What should I build at Hackagong?</h4>
					<div class="faq-content accordion-content">
						<p>Since you've only got a maximum of 30 hours, we're not expecting fully developed and polished products. Most teams will build a small prototype that solves a particular problem or is just really cool. So things like small web and mobile apps. There are various prize categories to work towards, so be sure to checkout the details. You can checkout what teams built at Hackagong 2013 on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/hackagong/videos" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>. There is also an <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/hackagongers/permalink/821125944616704/" target="_blank">ideas thread</a> in the Hackagongers group on Facebook.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="faq-wrap accordion-item">
				    <h4 class="faq-heading accordion-title">Can I compete across multiple prize categories?</h4>
					<div class="faq-content accordion-content">
						<p>Yep you can attempt to compete across all of the prize categories if you'd like. However you only have 30 hours total (with no sleep), so it's probably best to focus in the areas you have skills or passion in.</p>
					</div>
				</div>					
				<div class="faq-wrap accordion-item">
				    <h4 class="faq-heading accordion-title">Can I build anything I want?</h4>
					<div class="faq-content accordion-content">
						<p>Yeah you're welcome to build any project you'd like. There are specific prize categories to compete for which should cover most project ideas. The only projects we do not allow at Hackagong are anything illegal, sexual or offensive. Pretty obvious, but please don't build anything that involves porn, nudity, drugs, guns, violence or is offensive to any particular group of people. Also with the 3D printing competition, please don't design/print any objects like sex toys or guns (the media would have a field day).</p>
					</div>
				</div>				
				<div class="faq-wrap accordion-item">
				    <h4 class="faq-heading accordion-title">Who owns the IP of what gets made at the event?</h4>
					<div class="faq-content accordion-content">
						<p>100% of the intellectual property of anything made, belongs to the participating team. Hackagong, UOW and sponsors have zero ownership in what you create.</p>
					</div>
				</div>	
				<div class="faq-wrap accordion-item">
				    <h4 class="faq-heading accordion-title">Can I work on my project before Hackagong?</h4>
					<div class="faq-content accordion-content">
						<p>All development and work on your project should be performed during the Hackagong weekend. However it's fine to research and formulate the idea before the weekend. You're welcome to think of a name for the product/service and buy the domain name, do some basic market research to see if people want what you're selling, and look into what APIs, code libraries and code samples you could use. Then come in on the weekend and put all the pieces together. We don't check code, but judges will be able to tell if you've been working on the product for longer than a weekend.</p>
					</div>
				</div>			
				<div class="faq-wrap accordion-item">
				    <h4 class="faq-heading accordion-title">Can I use programming frameworks, libraries, APIs, engines etc?</h4>
					<div class="faq-content accordion-content">
						<p>Yeah definitely, you have a very short amount of time in which to build a functioning prototype. So use whatever tools you'd like to hack together something novel and unique.</p>
					</div>
				</div>		
				<div class="faq-wrap accordion-item">
				    <h4 class="faq-heading accordion-title">Do you check for illegitimate software and copyright infringement?</h4>
					<div class="faq-content accordion-content">
						<p>Nope, that would be a huge time sink for the organisers. We encourage you to use legit, purchased software and not to break any copyright infringements, but we won't be checking any computers. The art of creativity and hacking/mashing different things together cheaply and in a short amount of time, often requires operating outside the rules and status quo of the real world. Everything is a remix. Also try to avoid any obvious copyright and trademark infringements in naming and creating your product prototype as judges won't like it.</p>
					</div>
				</div>									
				<div class="faq-wrap accordion-item">
				    <h4 class="faq-heading accordion-title">Is food provided and what will it be?</h4>
					<div class="faq-content accordion-content">
						<p>Yes all food is provided as part of the ticket cost for the entire weekend, however we recommend you eat breakfast on the Saturday morning. We'll provide lunch and dinner for both days as well as breakfast on Sunday morning. These will be put out at specific times and announced (see schedule). There will also be assorted drinks (water, coffee, soft drink, juices, energy drinks) and assorted snacks (fruit, noodles, buns etc) you can help yourself to at anytime. The food is basic but filling. We need to feed upwards of 150 people, so we'll be serving things like Dominos pizza, chicken schnitzel burgers, Subway sandwiches etc. There will be vegetarian options, however if you have any other specific dietary requirements (vegan, gluten-free etc) please bring your own food or money to buy food from nearby locations.</p>
					</div>
				</div>	
				<div class="faq-wrap accordion-item">
				    <h4 class="faq-heading accordion-title">Do I need to bring money?</h4>
					<div class="faq-content accordion-content">
						<p>You shouldn't need to purchase anything (such as food) over the weekend, but please bring money and/or debit card just in case you want to buy additional food or have a very specific dietary requirement that we haven't catered for. You may also need to purchase your own drinks at the pub on Sunday night.</p>
					</div>
				</div>					
				<div class="faq-wrap accordion-item">
				    <h4 class="faq-heading accordion-title">Can I bring alcohol in?</h4>
					<div class="faq-content accordion-content">
						<p>No, we're strictly a non-alcohol event. Save that for the Sunday night after-party at the pub :)</p>
					</div>
				</div>	
				<div class="faq-wrap accordion-item">
				    <h4 class="faq-heading accordion-title">Is there a code of conduct?</h4>
					<div class="faq-content accordion-content">
						<p>Yes! Hackagong is an all-inclusive, open event, free of assholes and harassment. We've adopted the "Hack Code of Conduct" found <a href="http://hackcodeofconduct.org/hackagong" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

					<div class="faq-content accordion-content">
						<p>No, you're welcome to come and go as you please. Overnight stay is allowed. However doors will be locked from the outside from 10pm Saturday night, and re-opened again at 8am Sunday. To get back into the building during those times you will need to call the security guard or one of the organisers (numbers will be on the entrance door).</p>

				<div class="faq-wrap accordion-item">
				    <h4 class="faq-heading accordion-title">Do I have to work through the night, and what are the sleeping arrangements?</h4>
					<div class="faq-content accordion-content">
						<p>You're welcome to pull an all-nighter and continue working on your project through the night (snacks available through the night). However we encourage people to get at least a few hours of sleep. Feel free to go home to your own bed and come back in the morning. There are also bean bags that are great for taking a nap on, and there is a dark sleeping area where the games consoles are located.</p>

						<p>You're welcome to crash on the bean bags in the uniCentre. Showers are available on campus at the <a href="http://www.urac.com.au/index.html" target="_blank">URAC gym</a> so don't forget your towel hitchhikers (you may need to pay entry).

				<div class="faq-wrap accordion-item">
				    <h4 class="faq-heading accordion-title">Do you provide computers and software?</h4>
					<div class="faq-content accordion-content">
						<p>Not really. Please bring your own laptop (preferred) or desktop. Ample wifi, some wired ethernet and enough powerpoints will be available. We're providing 3D printers and some hardware devices for people wanting to build physical stuff. Outside of this, it's generally a BYO gear event. We're happy to make arrangements for people though, get in touch with us for more details about borrowing gear for the weekend.</p>
